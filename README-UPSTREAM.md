# FEXTendo / PES13-NX

FEXTendo is a Nintendo Switch launcher and compatibility **wrapper for the
Windows PC version of PES 2013**. It uses Wine, FEX-Emu and DXVK to run the PC
game; this repository contains the wrapper, integration code and build tools.

The **Switch port and Horizon/Wine integration of FEX-Emu in FEXTendo** are
developed by **AndroSwitch Project / Ibnuard**. The CPU translation engine is
upstream **FEX-Emu**; the Wine/Horizon runtime foundation comes from
**Wine-NX / Autorun**. See the [FEX port source and commit record](docs/FEX-PORT-PROVENANCE.md)
for our implementation work and the components we reuse or adapt. Our initial
FEX guest PASS on Switch predates the later, explicitly credited Autorun timer
backport and CPU-placement experiments.

**Provide your own installed PES 2013 PC version 1.0.** The game executable,
game data and installation code are not supplied by this repository.

> **Nota del fork:** este repositorio es un fork de FEXTendo / PES13-NX sobre el
> que se ha construido el port **07z (FIFA 07)**. Este fichero conserva el README
> original del wrapper; el README principal del repositorio es el de 07z

## Setup

1. Download the `FEXTendo-<version>-sd.zip` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/Ibnuard/pes13_nx/releases) and extract `switch/`
   to your SD root. This complete package includes the NRO, NSP forwarder,
   Wine/FEX/DXVK runtime, launcher assets, presets and default `settings.dat`.
   The standalone NRO/NSP downloads are for existing installations.
2. Copy your own game installation (`pes2013.exe`, accompanying game DLLs and
   `img/`) into `switch/pes13-fex/drive_c/PES13/`.
3. On the Windows PC where PES is installed, run
   [tools/export-metadata.py](tools/export-metadata.py). Copy the resulting
   `local/config/pes13-install.reg` to `switch/pes13-fex/pes13-install.reg`.
4. Install and launch the included `FEXTendo-PES13.nsp`, targeting
   `sdmc:/switch/pes13-fex/pes13-fex.nro` (32-bit address space, no alias, 4 cores,
   svcDebug disabled). Its icon matches the NRO.

Expected layout at the SD root (runtime folders shown below come from the
complete package; keep their other supplied files):

```text

├── pes13-fex.nro
├── configuration.ini
├── pes13-install.reg                 # from your own Windows installation

└── share/wine/                      # runtime fonts and NLS data
```

Keep the package's runtime DLLs and configuration when adding game files.
The launcher manages the canonical `drive_c/KONAMI/Pro Evolution Soccer
2013/settings.dat` and its compatibility copies. Keep installation metadata
private. Close the game before replacing runtime files.

Game-data and save directories are preserved in the release ZIP even when
empty. Only PRs merged into `main` run the package/release workflow. Each merge
publishes a versioned tag, release and generated changelog
(for example, `PES13 FEXTendo V.0.3.7`, with a revision for automatic packages).
See [release CI and runtime updates](docs/RELEASE-CI.md) for the approved
production input, checks and instructions for updating the runtime binaries.

The release runtime includes two controllers, horizontal Joy-Con mapping and
live keyboard editing with English labels and controller sprites. It retains
the production-v1 startup fix, silent runtime and pre-DFE FEX DLL.
